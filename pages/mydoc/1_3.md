Chapter 1 Introduction and Overview
Chapter 2 Traffic Data Sources and Factors
Chapter 3 Scoping for Project Traffic Forecasting
Chapter 4 Forecasting with Travel Demand Models
Chapter 5 Forecasting Without a Travel Demand Model
This chapter outlines the traffic forecasting processes for Corridor, Project, and ESAL studies and
describes general guidelines and techniques to be used in the Project Traffic Forecasting process.
This chapter describes the different types of traffic counters in operation, the existing traffic data
collection methodologies used in the state of Florida, and the estimation and tabulation of: Seasonal
Factor (SF), Axle Correction Factor (ACF), estimates of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), K Factor
(K) and Standard K Factor, Directional Distribution Factor (D), and Percent Trucks (T) for the current
year.
This chapter provides guidance on scope development for Project Traffic Forecasting. It covers
factors to be considered when preparing a scope, how to determine applicable forecasting methods,
how to identify the best sources of data, schedule guidelines, and document requirements and
deliverables.
This chapter provides guidance on the application of models to develop traffic projections for facility
specific PD&E studies, corridor studies, and RRR projects. This chapter provides an overview of travel
demand models, describes basic model calibration and validation techniques, and discusses the
use of model output for traffic forecasting.
This chapter provides a description of the appropriate methods of performing trend analysis and
examination of local land use plans, and other indicators of future growth in the Project Traffic
Forecasting process.
Chapter 6 Directional Design Hourly Volumes
This chapter describes the appropriate methods for converting model volume outputs to Annual
Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes and then into Directional Design Hourly Volumes (DDHVs), which
are used in the evaluation of roadway points, links, and facility analyses.
Chapter 7 Estimating Intersection Turning Movements
Chapter 8 Equivalent Single Axle Load Forecasting
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method for developing balanced turning movement
volumes at intersections. The FDOT Turning Movement Tool (TMTool) and TURNS5 Turning
Movement Analysis Tool (TURNS5-V2014) spreadsheets are explained in detail, and reviews of other
techniques are summarized.
This chapter describes the guidelines and techniques of forecasting Equivalent Single Axle Load
(ESAL) volumes for use in pavement design.
Chapter 9 Project Traffic for Tolled Managed Lanes
This chapter provides general discussions on unique issues in the Tolled Managed Lanes Project
Development process and offers guidance on the methodologies and processes for design traffic
development.
