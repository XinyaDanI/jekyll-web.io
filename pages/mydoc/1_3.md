Chapter 1 Introduction and Overview

This chapter outlines the traffic forecasting processes for corridor, project, and ESAL studies and describes general guidelines and techniques to be used in the Project Traffic Forecasting Process.

Chapter 2 Traffic Data Sources and Factors

This chapter describes the different types of traffic counters in operation, the current traffic data collection methodologies used in the State of Florida, and the estimation and tabulation of: Seasonal Factor (SF), Axle Correction Factor (ACF), estimates of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), K-Factor (K) and Standard K Factor, Directional Distribution Factor (D), and Percent Trucks (T) for the current year.

Chapter 3 Scoping for Project Traffic Forecasting

This chapter provides guidance on the development of a scope for project traffic forecasting. It covers factors to be considered when preparing a scope, how to determine applicable forecasting methods, how to identify best sources of data, schedule guidelines, and document requirements and deliverables.

Chapter 4 Forecasting with Travel Demand Models

This chapter provides guidance on the application of models to develop traffic projections for facility specific PD&E studies, corridor studies, and RRR projects. This chapter provides an overview of travel demand models, describes basic model calibration and validation techniques, and discusses the use of model output for traffic forecasting.

Chapter 5 Forecasting Without a Travel Demand Model

This chapter provides a description of the appropriate methods of performing trend analysis and examination of local land use plans, and other indicators of future growth in the project traffic forecasting process.

Chapter 6 Directional Design Hourly Volumes

This chapter describes the appropriate methods for converting model volume outputs to Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes and then into Directional Design Hourly Volumes (DDHVs), which are used in the evaluation of roadway points, links, and facility analyses.

Chapter 7 Estimating Intersection Turning Movements

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method for developing balanced turning movement volumes at intersections. The FDOT Turning Movement Tool (TMTool) and TURNS5 Turning Movement Analysis Tool (TURNS5-V2014) spreadsheets are explained in detail and reviews of other techniques are summarized.

Chapter 8 Equivalent Single Axle Load Forecasting

This chapter describes the guidelines and techniques of forecasting Equivalent Single Axle Load (ESAL) volumes for use in pavement design.

Chapter 9 Project Traffic for Corridors with Tolled Managed Lanes

This chapter provides general discussions on unique issues in the Express Lanes project development process and offers guidance on the methodologies and processes for design traffic development.
