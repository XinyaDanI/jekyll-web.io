There are three approaches to forecasting project traffic for Express Lanes:

<span style="color:#20a3d3"><b>9.3.1 Manual Estimation Using Peak Hour Origin-Destination (O-D)</b></span>

This method uses a manual estimation of the Express Lanes volume by applying a fixed percentage of the Express Lanes share of traffic to future year peak hour origin-destination (O- D) volumes. The shares of the Express Lanes can be derived from observed data on existing corridors, such as I-95 Express. The future year O-D volumes are developed through use of observed data and corridor forecasts from a travel demand model.

<span style="color:#20a3d3"><b>9.3.2 Travel Demand Model (TDM) Based</b></span>

<ol type="1">

<li style="margin:0;"><b>Regional TDM with Dynamic Toll Function or VTTS Curve Assignment</b><br>
Some Florida travel demand models have embedded highway assignment scripting to
specifically estimate Express Lanes traffic. The Southeast Regional Planning Model
(SERPM) uses a generalized cost assignment and a logit function that dynamically
calculates the toll after each iteration based on the volume to capacity (v/c) ratio in the
Express lanes. The Tampa Bay Regional Planning Model (TBRPM) uses predefined
VTTS curve to estimate the probability of the user to pay given the marginal cost/minute
saved, and a toll policy curve to describe how the toll varies by congestion as measured
by the volume to capacity ratio.</li>

<li style="margin:0"><b>Regional TDM with ELToD Static Assignment Model</b><br>ELToD is a traffic assignment tool used in conjunction with a regional travel demand
model to split traffic between Express Lanes and general use or general toll lanes. The
ELToD toll choice model uses travel time savings, costs, reliability, and trip distance to
calculate the percentage of travelers choosing the Express Lanes. ELToD estimates the
volume of traffic by hour on both the general use and the Express Lanes using a highway trip table from any travel demand model. In addition, it estimates the Express
Lanes dynamic toll and congested speeds by hour based on traffic conditions.</li>
</ol>

<span style="color:#20a3d3"><b>9.3.3 Microsimulation Model</b></span>

This method uses modules within microscopic simulation software packages to dynamically
assign traffic to the Express Lanes. Microscopic simulation models use a pricing component to
estimate the toll amount based on measured conditions such as travel time savings and speed.
An embedded decision model determines the probability of choice to use the Express Lanes
given the travel time savings and costs. When using microsimulation models, the decision
model should be modified so that it is  <span style="color:#0a69bb;font-weight:bold">consistent</span> with ELToD's toll choice model (<b>Equation 9-1</b>). In addition, the model has to be a DTA model which is based on the regional network. This
method requires O-D matrices from a macro- or meso-scopic model as an input to perform the
traffic assignment and can be part of a multi-resolution approach.

A core function of Express Lanes forecasting is to accurately account for traveler preferences to
choose the Express Lanes. This preference is largely influenced by the model inputs, such as
VTTS, VOR, and the dynamic toll amount. <b>Table 9-1</b> summarizes the model inputs for the
various Express Lanes forecasting methods described above, along with some pros and cons
for each method. It also includes the appropriate phase(s) in the project development process
where the method is recommended to use. Each project’s needs should be evaluated against
the various forecasting methods.

Manual estimation can be used to quickly approximate the anticipated range in traffic projections for an Express Lanes segment. The manual method is typically suited for sketch level activities on a simplified Express Lanes corridor and is generally not for project traffic forecasting at the PD&E or Design level. Regional travel demand models with customized highway assignment scripting can provide an estimation of Express Lanes demand at the period or daily level. However, the models do not account dynamic pricing fluctuations at the design hour level. In addition, the choice component used to calculate the Express Lanes share typically includes the VTTS and costs but excludes the VOR. Microsimulation models can provide the sensitivity to dynamic pricing but requires specialized scripting to include the VOR and the additional effort to properly calibrate the existing conditions model. As stated earlier, each project’s needs should be evaluated against the various forecasting methods.

<ul><i>Both ELToD and microsimulation models are only “assignment” models. Neither can be used without appropriate trip tables or O-D matrices produced by either a TDM or observed data with proper expansion to account for future growth.</i></ul>
