The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) collects and stores a broad range
of traffic data to assist highway engineers in maintaining and designing safe, state-
of-the art, and cost-effective facilities. Traffic data is collected by the FDOT’s Central
Office and district offices, local governments, and consultants. Traffic data collection
efforts include traffic volume, speed, vehicle classification counts, and/or truck
weight. The FDOT Transportation Data and Analytics (TDA) Office is responsible for
providing installation guidance, collecting, processing, storing traffic data and
finalization process (known as the end of the year process) to generate traffic count
data to be used in Department administration of highway programs along with
published data sets and reports. The purpose is to provide the Department with a
basis to meet FHWA’s reporting requirements to sustain the funding of federal
transportation programs, and to provide critical data required for engineering
analysis of existing facilities and to identify the need for expansion in the road
network.</div>
