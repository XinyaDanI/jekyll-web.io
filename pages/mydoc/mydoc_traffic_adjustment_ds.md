<div style="text-align: justify"> The continuous count and classification program is designed to collect vehicular and
classification traffic counts 24 hours a day throughout the year. The short-term
seasonal classification program is designed to collect classification counts for a short
period of time (24 to 72 hours). In addition, TDA has a Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) count
program which collects vehicle classification and truck weights. The various types of
traffic monitoring sites used in Florida during 2017 are presented in Figure 2-1. As
shown below, the FDOT TDA and district offices collected traffic count and traffic
factor information at 18,603 sites throughout Florida.</div>

### **2.3.1 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Continuous Vehicle Counts</span>**


<div style="text-align: justify"> The FDOT’s TDA Office collects traffic data through permanently installed traffic
counters located throughout the state. The Continuous Traffic Monitoring Sites
(Continuous TMSs) collect and record the distribution and variation of traffic flow by hour of the day, day of the week, and month of the year from year to year and
transmit the data daily to TDA via wireless cellular devices. Florida’s continuous
count program has 353 sites. The TDA or district office will determine when and
where new continuous sites are required. Often when major road construction
projects are undertaken, a count site will be included in the design plans at the
request of the TDA or district office. Generally, 3 to 4 new sites are installed each year and several others receive equipment upgrades. The continuous counters provide
the user with day-to-day traffic information throughout the year and the information
collected is used to produce AADT, K, and D factors.</div>


### **2.3.2 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Continuous Classification Counts</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> FDOT has approximately 236 permanently installed continuous classification
counters. The TDA Office collects classification data based on the classification of the
vehicle according to FHWA Vehicle Classification Scheme F. (See Figure 2-2). Truck
traffic data is collected through vehicle classification counts, which may be either
part of FDOT&#39;s Vehicle Classification Reporting Program or a special Vehicle
Classification study. There are currently 13 vehicle classification types ranging from
motorcycles (Class 1) to Multi-Trailer 7 or more-axle Trucks (Class 13). In addition, TDA
has a WIM count program which collects vehicle classification and truck weights.</div>
