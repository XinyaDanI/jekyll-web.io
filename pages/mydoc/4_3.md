The primary purpose of travel demand models is to provide system level traffic forecasts used to identify transportation needs in the development of long-range transportation plans. The resulting transportation plans provide a basis for more detailed evaluation required for specific project developments. Project Traffic Forecasting Reports document the procedure, methodology, and data used to develop traffic forecasts that serve as the basis in establishing specific improvements such as cross section requirements, lane calls for corridors, intersection/ interchange geometry, and pavement design.

Models can be useful tools in developing the traffic projections necessary for the Project Traffic Forecasting Report. However, before using traffic projections from a model, a careful examination of the performance of the model within the project area should be conducted to evaluate reasonableness and consistency of the model results. If necessary, additional model refinement and validation should be performed to ensure the model reflects the observed traffic conditions within the study area.

The travel demand forecasting models used in the State of Florida for projecting systems traffic are developed based on the modeling standards set forth by the Florida Model Task Force known as the Florida Standard Urban Transportation Model Structure (FSUTMS). MPO/TPO/TPAs used to develop and maintain their own individual models. However, with the increase in interregional travel and hence the need for coordinated transportation planning, with a few exceptions, most MPO/TPO/TPAs have their own models as part of a larger regional model. These regional models usually encompass multiple counties within an FDOT District. The District Planning Office, in coordination with each of the local MPO/TPO/TPA, are responsible for the development and maintenance of these models.

Models are typically calibrated and validated to reflect the travel behaviors as observed for a “base year”. The input data used for the model are population, employment, number of housing units, school enrollment, and the transportation network. The data sources needed to derive the observed travel characteristics include regional household travel surveys, National Household Travel Surveys (NHTS), most recent U.S. Census, American Community Survey (ACS), Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP), the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, local origin-destination surveys, external station survey, transit on-board survey, and other special purpose surveys. In recent years, “big data” provided by third party commercial vendors obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) devices or Location Based Services (LBS) have been routinely used for model validation purposes because of the relative low cost and large sample size associated with the data. A model is considered validated when traffic volumes generated by the model match the traffic counts reasonably well for the base year, and the model is sensitive to changes in input data and responds to changes appropriately. After a model is validated, it can be used to forecast future traffic using the projected population and employment data and the transportation network for a future year.

Models that have been adopted by the FDOT districts and MPO/TPO/TPAs should be used first to develop future project traffic. Depending on the location of the project, the Florida Statewide Model or the Florida Turnpike Model can also be used. The parameters and coefficients in the validated models should not be modified without the consent and approval of the responsible agencies. Since the availability of models varies from district to district, users should contact the District Modeling Coordinator to obtain the available models.

This section presents an overview of modeling fundamentals as they relate to project traffic development. It covers basic travel demand forecasting procedures and modules used in various models in Florida, advanced modeling techniques, state-of-the-practice input and output data, accuracy assessment of model results, and the available models in Florida.

<span class="subtitle-3">4.3.1 Travel Demand Forecasting Basics</span>

All travel demand models start with a geographical representation of the transportation system which consists of two parts. One is the demand side of the transportation system represented by geographic areas or zones and the traveling public that reside or work within the areas. The information needed to describe the traveling public is commonly known as the zonal data and it includes household, person, vehicle, and travel related characteristics. The other is the supply side of the transportation systems represented by multimodal transportation networks. The information used to describe the transportation networks and associated services includes number of lanes, capacity, type of facilities, speed limit, service schedule, etc. Travel demand models simulate the interactions between the supply side and demand side of the transportation system in different time slices based on observed or assumed travel behavioral principles and produce statistics that reflect the performance of the transportation system such as volumes, congested speeds, travel times and delays, and others. Models are typically developed for regional long- range transportation planning purposes. For many regional models, the zone size tends to be large, the transportation network could be sparse, and the model is often validated at a higher aggregate level. For project traffic purposes, a fine-grained zone system coupled with a high-level network detail is needed to properly reflect the traffic conditions within the project area. Model refinement and model adjustment are often needed.

<span class="subtitle-3">4.3.2 Four-Step Travel Demand Modeling</span>

There are different types of models based on planning requirements, data availability, and underlying assumptions about people’s travel decision making process. The sequential or four- step travel forecasting procedure is the most commonly used model for transportation engineering and planning purposes. The four-step model assumes that travelers make travel decisions in the following order:

+ <b>Trip Generation</b>
<div class="entry-content">
  <ul>
  <li>determines the frequency of origins or destinations of trips in each zone by trip purpose</li>
  <li>"what do I need to do, going to work, school, or shopping?"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

+ <b>Trip Distribution</b>
<div class="entry-content">
  <ul>
  <li>matches origins with destinations</li>
  <li>"where would I go, office, primary school, hospital?"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

+ <b>Mode Choice</b>
<div class="entry-content">
  <ul>
  <li>computes the proportion of trips between each origin and destination that use a particular transportation method</li>
  <li>"how should I go, driving, getting a ride, or using public transit?"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

+ <b>Trip Assignment</b>
<div class="entry-content">
  <ul>
  <li>allocates trips between an origin and destination by a particular mode to a route</li>
  <li>"what route should I take, shortest, fastest, cheapest, most familiar, safest?"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

The four-step model is often referred to as the trip-based model because the primary unit of analysis is a single trip interchange between two geographic locations or an origin-destination pair. Even though there are different behavioral assumptions and mathematical formulations for each step, the primary function of the trip-based models is to estimate the total number of trips in a region, classify them by location and mode, and predict their use of transportation networks. <b>Figure 4-3</b> illustrates a conceptual four-step modeling framework with main model components, input data, output data, and data flows among the model components. The model structure also includes a feedback loop used in some more advanced models to demonstrate possible improvements and enhancements to the model chain. Most of the travel demand models used in Florida are trip-based four-step models with various special features specifically designed to address the unique characteristics and planning needs in their modeling areas.

<span class="subtitle-3">4.3.3 Four-Step Model Enhancements</span>

There have been many enhancements within the four-step model framework to improve the accuracy and usability of the model. Examples include feedback loops that addresses the internal consistency issues within the model, time-of-day models that focus on travels during different time periods of the day, and various techniques that estimate trip tables directly from traffic counts or "big data" sources.

<span class="subtitle-4">4.3.3.1 Feedback Loops</span>

One of the common concerns about the sequential four-step models is the inconsistencies between the four steps, particularly the discrepancies between the travel times used for trip distribution and mode choice models and travel times produced by the trip assignment model. One way of resolving the inconsistencies is to implement the feedback loop in the model. The feedback loop is an iterative process where congested travel times from the trip assignment model are “fed back” to earlier steps of the model until the differences between the steps are reduced to an acceptable level.

<span class="subtitle-4">4.3.3.2 Time-of-Day Modeling</span>

In most urban areas where traffic congestion is a daily occurrence, travelers respond to congestion by adjusting their departure time to avoid the heaviest traffic and thus prolonging the peak period, a phenomenon known as peak spreading. In recent years, increasing flexibility with work schedule and the availability of telecommuting further contribute to the changes in temporal distribution of travel demand. Many of the Travel Demand Management measures or pricing policies are designed to reduce peak period traffic and alleviate traffic congestion. Various time- of-day (TOD) procedures and strategies have been employed to accurately capture the diurnal variations in travel demand and properly represent the traffic conditions during different times of the day.

Many of the models in Florida use TOD factors to disaggregate travel demand into different time periods. The TOD factors are developed either from household travel surveys or from traffic counts in the region. Within the four-step modeling framework, there are typically two ways of applying the TOD factors. One is to apply the TOD factors after trip assignment to allocate daily volumes into different time periods, the other is to apply the TOD factors before trip assignment to determine the travel demand separately for each period. In the latter case, separate trip assignment procedures are performed for different time periods to obtain traffic volumes for each period, and the daily volume is the sum of all period volumes.

There are also models in Florida that use more advanced techniques such as TOD choice models. The TOD choice models focus on predicting trip departure times based on preferred arrival time, expected and experienced travel times, and sometimes arrival delay penalties.
