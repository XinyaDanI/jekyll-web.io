<span class="subtitle-3">7.4.1 Background</span>

Generally, the accepted program for determining future year turning movements is TURNS5- V2014. It is used to develop future year turning movements based on one of two methods. The first method allows for the user to enter an existing year AADT and specify simple growth for three other periods (normally project opening, mid-design and design years). The second method allows for the user to input an existing year AADT and model forecast year AADT. The program will then interpolate or extrapolate for two other periods. It provides output of AADTs and DHVs and allows for comparisons and smoothing to ensure that the user is producing reasonable results.

TURNS5-V2014 was developed as a tool for the estimation of future turning volumes. TURNS5- V2014 is an Excel template which was developed by merging two other programs in use by several FDOT districts and creating a user driven menu and “file folder” windows for easier use. TURNFLOW1 and TURNS32 form the basic framework of the TURNS5-V2014 program.

TURNFLOW is an Excel template that provides a spreadsheet structure for estimating intersection turning movements when only approach volumes are known. The spreadsheet uses a technique for solving and balancing turning movement volumes based on an initial estimate of turning proportions entered by the user. The program iteratively balances volumes until a minimum tolerance is reached. This procedure was developed by E. Hauer, E. Pagitsas and B.T. Shin3. TURNFLOW and its documentation can be obtained from the McTrans Center of the University of Florida. It should be noted that the software is copyrighted and the TURNS5 program creators have secured its use for FDOT.

TURNS5-V2014 combines the intersection balancing component of TURNFLOW with the same basic setup relating to output, menu options and format similar to TURNS3. TURNS3 provides estimates of intersection turning movements and produces traffic volume outputs in a format suitable for use in various traffic analysis reports associated with preliminary engineering, planning, and Design studies.


<span class="subtitle-3">7.4.2 TURNS5 Methodology</span>

TURNS5-V2014 is designed to develop future turning volumes based on AADT volumes for the existing year and growth rates or by using an existing year AADT and a model year AADT. When using a model year, the program can calculate (interpolate/extrapolate) AADT for project years (normally opening, interim and design years). The program will also develop AADT volumes for three future years based on the existing year volumes and user specified growth rates for each projection year.

The TURNS5-V2014 program will project future year AADT volumes and balance each year’s future turning movement distribution based on an initial guess of turning percentages for each approach. Each year requested will be balanced using these initial guesses. It is recommended that the user input for these percentages be based on actual approach counts for the intersection. If existing turning movement counts are not available, the TURNS5-V2014 has two other “first guess turning percentages” methodologies available, Existing Year AADTs or FSUTMS Model Year AADTs. These methodologies utilize the AADTs input by the User.

It is important to note that the accuracy of predicted volumes is a function of the implied accuracy of user inputs. Existing and model year AADTs should be closely evaluated and checked for consistency with actual or proposed conditions for the roadway system under evaluation. Traffic counts should be checked for reasonableness of volumes and evaluated to identify vehicle flows into and out of the system for the existing condition. Reasonable assumptions for the model year must also be determined by the user. Random input of unchecked volumes or turning percentages will lead to program errors (turning movement balancing) or unrealistic output values.

In addition to this Handbook, TURNS5-V2014 has a companion <a href="https://fdotwww.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/planning/systems/systems-management/sm-old-files/traffic-analysis/turns5_v2014_documentation.pdf?sfvrsn=488b71ea_0" target="_blank">Tool Documentation</a> that explains the inner workings of TURNS5. It provides more details on each tab and what the 'Run Turn Counts Macro' button really does. The following text will serve as a User's Manual and should be sufficient for normal use of TURNS5-V2014.


<span class="subtitle-3">7.4.3 TURNS5-V2014 Spreadsheet Tabs (Worksheets)</span>

Upon loading the program in EXCEL, the program will automatically be positioned at the main menu (MainMenu tab) as shown in <b>Figure 7-1</b>. The following tabs are contained within the workbook:
