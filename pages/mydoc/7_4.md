Generally, the accepted program for determining future year turning movements is TURNS5- V2014. It is used to develop future year turning movements based on one of two methods. The first method allows for the user to enter an existing year AADT and specify simple growth for three other periods (normally project opening, mid-design and design years). The second method allows for the user to input an existing year AADT and model forecast year AADT. The program will then interpolate or extrapolate for two other periods. It provides output of AADTs and DHVs and allows for comparisons and smoothing to ensure that the user is producing reasonable results.

TURNS5-V2014 was developed as a tool for the estimation of future turning volumes. TURNS5- V2014 is an Excel template which was developed by merging two other programs in use by several FDOT districts and creating a user driven menu and “file folder” windows for easier use. TURNFLOW1 and TURNS32 form the basic framework of the TURNS5-V2014 program.

TURNFLOW is an Excel template that provides a spreadsheet structure for estimating intersection turning movements when only approach volumes are known. The spreadsheet uses a technique for solving and balancing turning movement volumes based on an initial estimate of turning proportions entered by the user. The program iteratively balances volumes until a minimum tolerance is reached. This procedure was developed by E. Hauer, E. Pagitsas and B.T. Shin3. TURNFLOW and its documentation can be obtained from the McTrans Center of the University of Florida. It should be noted that the software is copyrighted and the TURNS5 program creators have secured its use for FDOT.

TURNS5-V2014 combines the intersection balancing component of TURNFLOW with the same basic setup relating to output, menu options and format similar to TURNS3. TURNS3 provides estimates of intersection turning movements and produces traffic volume outputs in a format suitable for use in various traffic analysis reports associated with preliminary engineering, planning, and Design studies.

7.4.2 TURNS5 Methodology

TURNS5-V2014 is designed to develop future turning volumes based on AADT volumes for the existing year and growth rates or by using an existing year AADT and a model year AADT. When using a model year, the program can calculate (interpolate/extrapolate) AADT for project years (normally opening, interim and design years). The program will also develop AADT volumes for three future years based on the existing year volumes and user specified growth rates for each projection year.

The TURNS5-V2014 program will project future year AADT volumes and balance each year’s future turning movement distribution based on an initial guess of turning percentages for each approach. Each year requested will be balanced using these initial guesses. It is recommended that the user input for these percentages be based on actual approach counts for the intersection. If existing turning movement counts are not available, the TURNS5-V2014 has two other “first guess turning percentages” methodologies available, Existing Year AADTs or FSUTMS Model Year AADTs. These methodologies utilize the AADTs input by the User.

It is important to note that the accuracy of predicted volumes is a function of the implied accuracy of user inputs. Existing and model year AADTs should be closely evaluated and checked for consistency with actual or proposed conditions for the roadway system under evaluation. Traffic counts should be checked for reasonableness of volumes and evaluated to identify vehicle flows into and out of the system for the existing condition. Reasonable assumptions for the model year must also be determined by the user. Random input of unchecked volumes or turning percentages will lead to program errors (turning movement balancing) or unrealistic output values.

In addition to this Handbook, TURNS5-V2014 has a companion Tool Documentation that explains the inner workings of TURNS5. It provides more details on each tab and what the ‘Run Turn Counts Macro’ button really does. The following text will serve as a User’s Manual and should be sufficient for normal use of TURNS5-V2014.

7.4.3 TURNS5-V2014 Spreadsheet Tabs (Worksheets)

Upon loading the program in EXCEL, the program will automatically be positioned at the main menu (MainMenu tab) as shown in Figure 7-1. The following tabs are contained within the workbook:

MainMenu
MainMenu – Contains the Main Menu where all of the macro driven buttons are located.
InputSheet
Enter Data
InputSheet – Contains all of the data that the user entered into the \"Enter Data\" menus. The user may also individually edit the gray boxes of information within this tab, but it is recommended that the \"Enter Data\" menu system is used to ensure that the correct types of values are entered. However, if any information is changed by manually entering values into the tab or using the \"Enter Data\" menus, the \"Run Turn Counts Macro\" button should be selected in order to run the macro with the updated information.
Calcs
Run Turn Counts Macro
Calcs – Contains placeholder cells and the information necessary for the iterative process of the \"Run Turn Counts Macro\". This tab is where the macro will perform the balancing calculations for each study year. No information within this tab should be altered
OutputSheet
OutputSheet – Contains the initial turning volume summary. This is one of three output graphics where the calculated turning percentages and volumes are displayed in a table for each study year. No information within this tab should be altered.
TurnSheets
TurnSheets – Contains the second and third output graphics. The second output graphic contains the design hour turning movements along with the turning distributions, AADTs, DDHVs, and traffic factors. The third and last output graphic compares the base year turning movement volumes to the future year turning movement volumes. No information within this tab should be altered.
Data
Data – Contains information that helps the menu system and \"Run Turn Counts Macro\" run.
XML
XML – Contains the information that will be exported to a .XML file.

7.4.3.1 Main Menu Options

The Main Menu contains the following buttons:

Clear Sheet for New Data
Clear Sheet for New Data – erases any previous information input into the spreadsheet. This action cannot be 'undone'.
Enter Data
Enter Data – prompts the pop-up input menus where the user can input data. The menus will reference the data currently in the workbook, presumably the information the user last input. If the workbook is blank the \"Enter Data\" menus will be blank.
Run Turn Counts Macro
Run Turn Counts Macro – activates the iterative macro. This action cannot be 'undone'.
Save Data File
Save Data File – activates the Excel Save As menu.
Check Data
Check Data – searches for any error messages previously generated by the iterative macro. For example, if the \"Run Turn Counts Macro\" has not been run since reactivating the \"Enter Data\" menu and proceeding to page 2, the message \"Turn counts macro was not run after changing input. Click the 'Run Turn Counts Macro' button\" will appear. The macro assumes that information was changed since the \"Enter Data\" menu was activated and the information from page 1 was rewritten into the appropriate cells. However, if information was not changed through the \"Enter Data\" menu but by manually editing the \"InputSheet\" tab, the previously mentioned error message will not appear. Nevertheless, if any input data has been changed, click the \"Run Turn Counts Macro\" button.
Print Preview and Print
Print Preview and Print – activates Print Preview within Excel. The input sheet, the turning volume summary and the output graphics will be available to preview before printing. When ready to print, click the \"Print\" button and select the desired printer. To exit Print Preview, click \"Close Print Preview\".
Export XML
Export XML – exports to an XML file.
7.4.4 ‘Enter Data’ Menus
