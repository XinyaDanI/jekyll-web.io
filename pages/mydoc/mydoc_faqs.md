<h2 style="padding-top:36px">General Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of the Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook (PTFH) and who uses the handbook?</li>

<li>When is project traffic forecasting needed through project development process?</li>

<li>What is the process for traffic forecasting? Or what are the steps for traffic forecasting?</li>
<li>Can this Handbook be used to develop project traffic for non-state road projects?</li>
<li>Is there any training offered on how to use the Handbook?</li>
<li>Who should be contacted if there are technical questions regarding the Handbook?</li>
<li>Is there web site to download Traffic Trend Analysis, TURNS, TMTool, and 18 KIP spreadsheets?</li>
<li>When would project traffic considered to be too old?</li>
<li>What traffic should be used for a project that has in interim phase?</li>
<li>Is the methodology for developing project traffic for a project with managed lanes similar to traditional methods?</li>
<li>How is the project traffic developed for a new corridor?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technical Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Which locations are included in the Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) count program?</li>
<li>Where can I find the appropriate factors for adjusting historic traffic counts?</li>
<li>When do you apply axle correction factors?</li>
<li>What is the source for seasonal and axle factors?</li>
<li>When to use Peak Season Conversion Factor (PSCF) and seasonal factors?</li>
<li>How should I address outliers in traffic counts when establishing traffic growth trend?</li>
<li>How to decide the existing year and the analysis forecasting years for a project?</li>
<li>Where to find the proper Travel Demand Model for project traffic forecasting?</li>
<li>How to adjust the AADT when model forecasting years are different than the project analysis years?</li>
<li>How to balance the estimated intersection turning movements along the study corridor?</li>
<li>What DHV volumes should be used if both the future AADT and turning movement volumes were forecasted? The DHV from turning movement volumes or from AADT*K%?</li>
<li>Are there any standards for non-state road, such as the roadway should be classified as arterial, in order to apply for standard K factors and acceptable range of D factors? </li>
<li>Is there minimum growth rate for future traffic forecasting?</li>
<li>When applying the rounding conversion to the volumes, the forecasted volumes for different forecasting years may be the same in some cases due to low growth. Is there a guidance to differentiate these forecasted volumes?</li>
<li>How to decide the appropriate method to estimate intersection turning movements?</li>
<li>Should the Standard K Factor be applied on the non-state roads to develop project traffic forecast?</li>
<li>How to calculate 18 Kip ESALs when historical AADT shows a decreasing trend?</li>
<li>When calculating 18 Kip ESALs, what is the guidance to input for number of lanes in one direction when there are odd number for lanes on the study roadway?</li>
</ul>
