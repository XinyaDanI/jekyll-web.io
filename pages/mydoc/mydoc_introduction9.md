Managed lanes are a TSM&amp;O solution where highway facilities or sets of lanes within a highway facility use management strategies to provide congestion relief. The three primary management strategies used are access control, vehicle eligibility, and tolling. When tolling is an option for immediate or future use, the managed lane is an express lane. Express Lanes are a type of managed lanes where pricing through electronic tolling is applied to lanes. Project traffic forecasts for Express Lanes require an additional level of effort compared with the forecasting methods provided in this Handbook. If the managed lanes do not incorporate tolling, then this chapter is not applicable.

Managed lanes limit access points, which affects trip eligibility and potential demand for the facility. In addition, since Express Lanes use tolling to manage congestion, there is varying demand for the facility. As such, <span style="color:#0a69bb">Express Lanes traffic cannot be forecasted using a typical project traffic forecast procedure that applies Standard K and D factors to AADTs</span>. This chapter provides general discussions on unique issues in the Express Lanes project development process and offers guidance on the methodologies and processes for project traffic development.

As Express Lanes are developed and various operating strategies are assessed around the state, it is apparent that the complexity of the Express Lanes operations is greater than those of the traditional roadways. FDOT has developed a Managed Lanes Guidebook to provide guidance on the planning and implementation processes of managed lanes projects and associated technical, organizational, and outreach requirements. The intent of this chapter of the Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook is to supplement the FDOT Managed Lanes Guidebook and provide additional guidance on the development of project traffic during the project development process for Express Lanes. <span style="color:#0a69bb">This chapter is not intended for use in traffic and revenue studies.</span>
