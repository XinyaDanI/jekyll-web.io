keywords: "Express lanes limit access points, which affects trip eligibility and potential demand for the facility. In addition, since Express Lanes use tolling to manage congestion, there is varying demand for the facility. As such, Express Lanes traffic cannot be forecasted using a typical project traffic forecast
procedure that applies Standard K and D factors to AADTs. This chapter provides general discussions on unique issues in the Express Lanes project development process and offers guidance on the methodologies and processes for project traffic development.

As Express Lanes are developed and various operating strategies are assessed around the state, it is apparent that the complexity of the Express Lanes operations is greater than those of the traditional roadways. FDOT has developed a Managed Lanes Guidebook to provide guidance on the planning and implementation processes of managed lanes projects and associated technical, organizational, and outreach requirements. The intent of this chapter of the Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook is to supplement the FDOT Managed Lanes Guidebook and provide additional guidance on the development of project traffic during the project development process for Express Lanes. This chapter is not intended for use in traffic and revenue studies."
