This chapter provides guidance on the application of travel demand models to develop project traffic. It covers the fundamentals of travel demand modeling, selection of an appropriate model, project-level model validation and reasonableness check, and refinement of model output to obtain consistent traffic forecasts. If an acceptable model is not available for a project, then refer to <b>Chapter 5</b>.

The following sections provide guidance on the use of models to develop traffic projections for project, corridor, and RRR projects. This guidance applies only to areas where an adopted/endorsed model is available. Data requirements and the level of modeling effort vary by the type of project.
