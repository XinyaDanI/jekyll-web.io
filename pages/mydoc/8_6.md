    <div style="color:#20a3d3; font-weight:bold; text-align:left">Receive request for 18-KIP ESAL estimation</div>

    The request for ESAL estimation could come as a stand-alone request, or as part of the general project traffic request. Each FDOT district has a different format and specific time framework to complete the work. Users are advised to consult with District Planning Office and/or individual Project Mangers before starting the work. <b>Figure 8-4</b> shows an example of Project Traffic Request form. Typical information requested includes AADT for project analysis years, K, D, and T factors, turning movement volumes, and 18-KIP ESAL Report.

    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">Additional information including Functional Classification (RCI Feature 121), Through Lanes (RCI Feature 212), Median (RCI Feature 215), Speed Limits (RCI Feature 311) and Traffic Flow Breaks (RCI Feature 331) can be accessed through <a href="https://fdotewp1.dot.state.fl.us/slogis/" target="_blank">Straight-Line Diagrams Online GIS Web Application</a> (See <b>Figure 8-5</b>).</div>

    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">Check Florida Traffic Online (FTO) for Continuous TMS or Short-Term TMS stations within the project limits or in close proximity (one mile on either side of the limits). Download the Historical AADT Report. This report also contains T24, and Design Hour Truck factor. Depending on the budget or schedule, request 24-hour to 72-hour short-term vehicle classification counts at the study location.</div>

    <div style="color:#20a3d3; font-weight:bold; text-align:left">Request Model Volumes</div>

    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">Request the modeling staff to provide adopted model volumes for both base year and future year for the project area. If the model volumes are not readily available, request a copy of the model and run the model to generate model volumes. Convert the model data from PSWADT to AADT using MOCF if needed. <b>Figure 8-6</b> shows an example of model volume plot displaying assigned traffic volume along the study corridor in Brevard County.</div>

    <div style="color:#20a3d3; font-weight:bold; text-align:left">Determine Existing Year AADT</div>

    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">Calculate average daily traffic volumes from short-term vehicle classification counts. Apply an appropriate Seasonal Factor to convert the ADT to AADT. No axle adjustment is needed if vehicle classification counts are collected. If short-term traffic counts are not collected, estimate existing year AADT using information from Florida Traffic Online (FTO), other studies, or similar facilities nearby.</div>

    <div style="color:#20a3d3; font-weight:bold; text-align:left">Example:</div>
    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">48-hour classification counts were taken on August 23 and 24, 2022. The daily counts for the two days are 32,572 and 32,553. The corresponding Season Factor is 1.05. The Existing Year AADT is calculated as follows:</div>
    $$ADT=\frac{32,572 + 32,553}{2}=32,563$$
    $$AADT=ADT\times{SF}=32,563\times{1.05}=34,191$$
    $$AADT=34,000$$

    <div class="child2">
    <div style="color:#20a3d3; font-weight:bold; text-align:left">Determine Design Traffic Characteristics</div>

    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">Develop design hour factors K, D, and T<sub>24</sub> following the guidelines described in <b>Chapter 2</b>. The subject facility is a suburban arterial and the roadway context classification is Suburban Commercial (C3C). The K Factor should be a single value within the Standard K Factor Range as shown in <b>Table 2-1</b> based on the context classification, area type, and facility type. The D and T factors are determined by comparing the measured factors from the short-term vehicle classification counts with the respective factors reported in the FDOT RCI database. The recommended values should be within the allowable range and reflect the typical travel characteristics observed in the past and expected in the future.</div>

    <div style="color:#20a3d3; font-weight:bold; text-align:left">Example:</div>
    <div style="margin:0.4em 0">The measured Peak-to-Daily ratio was 7.94%, which is within the Standard K Range for the facility. The "D" value based on the short-term classification counts was 52.76% for the study location. The FDOT RCI database reported a D value of 53.40% for a FDOT Short-Term TMS site nearby. The measured daily truck factor (T<sub>24</sub>) from the classification count was 5.01%. The FDOT RCI database reported a daily truck factor of 4.50% for the same FDOT Site. Based on the comparison, the Standard K-Factor of 8.00%, the D Factor of 52.76%, and the daily truck factor (T<sub>24</sub>) of 5.01% are recommended, all based on field measured data at the site. </div>
