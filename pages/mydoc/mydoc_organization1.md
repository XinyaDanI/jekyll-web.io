This Handbook consists of eight (8) chapters and three (3) Appendices:

### **Chapter 1 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Introduction and Overview</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter outlines the traffic forecasting processes for corridor, project, and
Equivalent Single Axle Load (ESAL) studies and describes general guidelines and
techniques to be used in the Project Traffic Forecasting Process.</div>

### **Chapter 2 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Traffic Data Sources and Factors</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter describes the different types of traffic counters in operation, the current
traffic data collection methodologies used in the State of Florida, and the estimation
and tabulation of: Seasonal Factors (SF), Axle Correction Factors (ACF), estimates of
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), K-Factor (K) and Standardized K, Directional
Distribution Factor (D), and Percent Trucks (T) for the current year.</div>

### **Chapter 3 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Forecasting with Travel Demand Models</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter provides guidance on the application of models to develop traffic
projections for facility specific PD&amp;E studies, corridor studies, and RRR projects. This
chapter also provides an overview of modeling for traffic engineers and an overview
of traffic forecasting requirements for modelers.</div>

### **Chapter 4 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Forecasting without Travel Demand Models</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter provides a description of the appropriate methods of performing trend
analysis and examination of local land use plans, and other indicators of future
growth in the project traffic forecasting process.</div>

### **Chapter 5 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Directional Design Hourly Volumes</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter describes the appropriate methods for converting model volume
outputs to Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes and then into Directional
Design Hourly Volumes (DDHVs), which are used in the evaluation of roadway
points, links, and facility analyses.</div>

### **Chapter 6 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Estimating Intersection Turning Movement</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method for developing balanced turning
movement volumes at intersections. The TURNS5-V2014 spreadsheet and TMTool are
explained in detail and reviews of other techniques are summarized.</div>

### **Chapter 7 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Equivalent Single Axle Load Forecast</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter describes the guidelines and techniques of forecasting Equivalent
Single Axle Load (ESAL) volumes for use in pavement design.</div>

### **Chapter 8 <span style="color:#0a69bb">Project Traffic for Corridors with Priced Managed Lanes</span>**

<div style="text-align: justify"> This chapter provides general discussions on unique issues in the Express Lanes
project development process and offers guidance on the methodologies and
processes for design traffic development.</div>
