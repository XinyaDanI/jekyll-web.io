<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">What is the purpose of the Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook (PTFH) and who uses the handbook?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer1">
As stated in <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/1_2.html" target="_blank">Section 1.2</a>, the purpose of the PTFH is to describe policies and procedures accepted by the FDOT and offer guidelines on principles and techniques for preparing project traffic required by various stages of the project development process. The objective is to help standardize the traffic forecasting process that will result in consistent and defendable project traffic on all applicable transportation projects.<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>

As for who uses the handbook, the intended audience is transportation engineers and planners who develop project traffic for various highway projects for FDOT and its partner agencies in the state of Florida. This Handbook may be used by local governments and other agencies to review, accept, or approve project traffic developed for highway projects within their jurisdictions.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">When is project traffic forecasting needed through the project development process?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer2">
As outlined in <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/index.html" target="_blank">Section 1.1</a>, project traffic forecasting plays an integral role in the project development process. It helps decision-makers evaluate their options and select the best alternatives to meet project goals and objectives. Here are the key stages in the project development process where traffic forecasting is typically required:
<ol>
<li style="margin:0.3rem 0">Corridor: used to make decisions with important capacity and capital investment implications. The Corridor Traffic Forecasting is required before establishing a new alignment or widening of an existing facility.</li>
<li style="margin:0.3rem 0">Project: used to develop lane configuration requirements for intersection designs, and to evaluate the operational efficiency of proposed improvements. It is also required for reconstruction, resurfacing, lane addition, bridge replacement, new roadway projects, and major intersection improvements.</li> 
<li style="margin:0.3rem 0">18-KIP ESAL: required for the pavement design for new construction, reconstruction, and RRR projects that require a structural loading forecast.</li>
</ol>
In summary, project traffic forecasting is needed at various stages throughout the project development process to inform decision-making and design considerations.
</div>



<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">What is the process for traffic forecasting? Or what are the steps for traffic forecasting?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer3">

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer8')">When would project traffic be considered to be too old?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer8">
In general, it's recommended to use the most recent and relevant traffic data available for project analysis. Project traffic data can become outdated over time, and determining when it is considered "too old" depends on several factors, including the purpose of the data, the land use change in the area, and the specific project or analysis in question. When using older data, it's important to acknowledge its limitations and consider the potential need for adjustments or validation to account for changes in traffic patterns over time.<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>
As stated in Part 1 Section 4.2.2 of the <a href="https://www.fdot.gov/environment/pubs/pdeman/pdeman-current" target="_blank">PD&E Manual</a>, effective July 1, 2023, the planning product being adopted into the NEPA analysis was approved within the 5-year period ending on the date on which the information is adopted or incorporated by reference.

</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer14')">Where can I find the appropriate factors for adjusting historical traffic counts?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer14">
Historical traffic counts are typically used to establish traffic growth trends. There are no specific factors for adjusting historical traffic counts if the count data obtained from the FTO website is already AADTs. Otherwise, please refer to <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/2_5.html" target="_blank">Section 2.5.1</a> for converting ADT to AADT. Additional checks may be conducted to see if the count data is computed (field collected) or estimated due to various reasons that the data collection could not be performed for the specific year(s), or if the count data had experienced significant impacts such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer15')">When do you apply axle correction factors?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer15">
As stated in <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/2_4.html" target="_blank">Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2</a>, Seasonal Factor Category is determined by using traffic data collected from permanent count location to develop monthly seasonal factor and weekly factor. ACF are determined by using the data from continuous and short-term classification counts following the guidelines as described in the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/" target="_blank">FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide</a>. The seasonal and axle factors can be downloaded from the FTO website by selecting the Traffic Reports in terms of Peak Season Factor Category and Weekly Axle Factor Category. More details of using the reports are included in <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/2_9.html" target="_blank">Sections 2.9.1 and 2.9.2</a>.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer16')">When to use Peak Season Conversion Factor (PSCF) and seasonal factors?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer16">
Seasonal Factors (SF) are used to convert an average weekday 24-hour traffic count to AADT. Peak Season Conversion Factors (PSCF) are used to convert a 24-hour count, representing the average weekday daily traffic, to PSWADT. Please refer to <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/4_7.html" target="_blank">Section 4.7.3</a> for more details.

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer17')">How should I address outliers in traffic counts when establishing the traffic growth trend?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer17">
Addressing outliers in traffic counts is essential when establishing a traffic growth trend to ensure that the trend accurately reflects the typical traffic patterns. Here are recommendations to address outliers:<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>
1. Identify Outliers: start by identifying outliers in the traffic count data. Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the overall trend or pattern. Common techniques for identifying outliers include visual inspection of data plots, statistical methods, and automated outlier detection algorithms.<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>
2. Understand the Source of Outliers: investigate the reasons behind the outliers. Outliers can result from various factors, such as data collection errors, equipment malfunctions, extreme weather events, accidents, construction, or special events. Understanding the source of outliers is crucial for deciding how to address them.<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>
3. Statistical Methods: consider applying statistical methods to handle outliers, such as replacing outliers with the nearest non-outlying values, removing a fixed percentage of the most extreme outliers from the dataset.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer18')">How to decide the existing year and the analysis forecasting years for a project?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer18">
For project traffic forecasting purposes, the base year is the year when system data is collected to evaluate the existing conditions and establish the purpose and needs of a project. Please refer to <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/4_2.html" target="_blank">Section 4.2.3</a> for more details. If a different existing or analysis forecasting year is proposed, please clearly document your rationale for selecting the existing and forecasting years. Ultimately, the choice of existing and forecasting years should align with the project's objectives and requirements. It should also consider the availability of reliable data and account for factors that may impact transportation conditions over the chosen timeframe. The FDOT Project Manager and other relevant stakeholders should be consulted to establish analysis years before the project begins.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer19')">Where to find the proper Travel Demand Model for project traffic forecasting?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer19">
Please refer to <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/4_3.html" target="_blank">Section 4.3.5</a> for travel demand models available in Florida. Additional information can be found from the following <a href="https://www.fsutmsonline.net/index.php/model_pages/model_pages/" target="_blank">FSUTMS Web Portal</a>.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer20')">How to adjust the AADT when model forecasting years are different than the project analysis years?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer20">
As mentioned in Section 4.2.3, in many cases, the model base year is different from the project base year. Likewise, the forecast year of the model could be different than the design year of the project. Standard data processing procedures, such as linear interpolation or extrapolation, should be used to ensure that the model provides traffic forecasts for both the opening and design year of the project.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer21')">How to balance the estimated intersection turning movements along the study corridor?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer21">
Manually balancing the estimated intersection turning movements can be time and labor intensive and presents challenge with review and quality control, especially with large project areas. It is recommended that count data be adjusted and balanced between upstream and downstream locations using Excel spreadsheets or other tools that can help with review and quality control. There are several methods considered for balancing: split the difference between intersections, higher volume distributed to all movements, higher volume distributed to through movements, spreadsheet link volume forcing, and a combination of all or some of the other methods. In addition, Synchro can be used as a tool for intersection turning movements balancing, especially along arterial corridors where signal timing and other traffic analyses are being conducted. Synchro can display the traffic volume imbalance along a link, which can help expedite the balancing process.<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>
As specified in Section 5.8 Quality Assurance of <a href="https://fdotwww.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/planning/systems/systems-management/document-repository/traffic-analysis/traffic-analysis-handbook_05-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=cecdd23b_2" target="_blank">2021 FDOT Traffic Analysis Handbook</a>, a 10% difference between upstream and downstream counts for location with no known traffic sources or sinks (such as driveways or parking garage) is considered acceptable. However, some districts have more stringent requirements, such as 7%. Please consult with the individual districts to establish the minimum acceptable threshold.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer22')">Are there any standards for non-state roads, such as the roadway should be classified as arterial, in order to apply for standard K factors and acceptable range of D factors?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer22">
As stated in <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/2_5.html" target="_blank">Section 2.5.2.2</a>, a new approach to developing the Standard K Factors considers context classification, area type, and facility type of a roadway segment. It is recommended that the selected K Factor for a project fall within the K Factor Range. With the new K Factor Range, there could still be cases where the K Factor Range may not directly apply. In such cases, short-term traffic counts that include both weekdays and weekends should be collected. K Factors should be developed by analyzing the short-term traffic counts and relevant traffic information from FTO, if available.<div style="margin:0.6rem 0"></div>
As stated in <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/2_5.html" target="_blank">Section 2.5.3.2</a>, If traffic counts for the project site are not available, obtain short-term traffic counts to determine hourly traffic volume distribution. This will allow the identification of the peak hour of the day and peak direction during the peak hour. If no counts are available, the intersecting roadways that are non-state maintained will use the same D-Factor as the project roadway on the state highway system. The D-Factors should be checked to see if they are within the allowable range.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer23')">Is there a minimum growth rate for future traffic forecasting?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer23">
There is no specific minimum growth rate prescribed universally for future traffic forecasting because the rate of traffic growth can vary significantly depending on the region, location, type of road, economic conditions, and other factors. In the case that the calculated traffic growth rate is unreasonably higher or lower than growth rates from other sources, a comprehensive traffic growth rate should be established using more data sources. It is recommended that the expected population or employment growth of the area and the overall average traffic growth rate for all roadways in the area be considered. When a trend analysis produces minimal or negative traffic growth rates, a minimum traffic growth rate of 0.5 percent annually is currently applied to traffic forecasting in some districts, but it is recommended to work with individual district offices to establish the appropriate minimum growth rate for the study at hand.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer24')">When applying the rounding convention to the volumes, the forecasted volumes for different forecasting years may be the same in some cases due to low growth rate. Is there a guidance to differentiate these forecasted volumes?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer24">
Currently there is no specific guidance to differentiate these forecasted volumes in this case. Additional documentation or reporting a volume as "between 10,000 and 10,500 vehicles per day” may help understand how the forecasts were derived.
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer25')">How to decide the appropriate method to estimate intersection turning movements?</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer25">
Please refer to <a href="https://xinyadani.github.io/jekyll-web.io/7_8.html" target="_blank">Section 7.8</a> regarding the two main tools used in Florida for developing turning movement volumes.
