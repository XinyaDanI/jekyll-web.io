When collecting the turning movement counts, it should be noted that most turning movement counts at signalized intersections are performed by counting vehicles as they pass through the intersection, ignoring the unmet demand. This produces unrealistic data in oversaturated conditions, which does not represent the true demand at the intersection. Performing capacity analyses using data collected this way can severely underestimate the delay and back-of-queue results and yield inaccurate levels of service. For congested signals, arrival demand (not departure flows) must be used for the capacity analysis to accurately match field conditions.

In some cases, if existing turning movement counts are available and no major changes in land use patterns are expected, a growth factor method can be used to develop future turning movement volumes. However, approval from the District Planning Office or Project Manager is required before applying the simple methodology.
