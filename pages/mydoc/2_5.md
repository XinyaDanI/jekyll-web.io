The AADT, the peak-to-daily ratio or the design hour factor (K), the directional distribution factor (D), and the percent trucks (T) are critical numbers that determine the geometric configuration of a roadway. In addition, the T factor is critical for determining the type and thickness of pavement during design.

The actual AADT and other traffic factors can only be measured through Continuous TMSs that collect data 365 days a year. In most cases, traffic parameters have to be estimated from Short-term traffic counts. The information collected from Continuous TMS locations provides a statistical basis for estimating traffic parameters for the short-term traffic counts.

    <div class="child1"><div style="background:#20a3d3; color:white; font-weight: bold; padding:0.5rem 0.5rem 0.5rem 0.5rem; text-align:center">AADT</div></div>
    <div class="child2"><b>The Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT)</b> is the estimate of typical daily traffic on a road segment for all seven days of the week from Sunday to Saturday, over the period of one year. AADT is determined by dividing the total number of vehicles on a roadway segment for one year by the number of days (365 days, except Leap Year which has 366 days) in the year. The AADT is the best measure of the total use of a road, because it includes all traffic for an entire year.</div>
</div>

Average Daily Traffic (ADT) is obtained by a short-term traffic count. Short-term traffic counts are commonly referred to as “raw counts” or simply “traffic count.” ADT is typically a 72-hour traffic counts collected on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. However, ADT can be based on the simple average of any short-term traffic counts at least 24 hours long. The 24-hour and 48-hour traffic counts are often taken to measure ADT and converted to AADT for traffic forecasting projects. For traffic forecasts, the Seasonal Factor (SF) and Axle Correction Factor (ACF), where applicable, should be used to convert ADT to AADT as shown in <b>Equation 2-3</b>.

$$AADT=ADT\times{SF}\times{ACF}$$
<div class="italic-grey">Equation 2-3</div>

<ul><i>Axle Correction Factors (ACF) should only be applied to short-term counts obtained from portable axle counters, not vehicle classification counts.</i></ul>
</div>

When the ADT is adjusted by SF and ACF assigned to that site, it will provide a statistically accurate estimate of AADT at that location.

<span class="subtitle-3">2.5.2 K Factor and Standard K Factor Range</span>

<span class="subtitle-4">2.5.2.1 K Factor </span>

The K factor is defined as the proportion of AADT occurring in the peak hour. It is one of the most critical traffic factors in roadway planning and design. The K factor is often referred to as the Design Hour Factor as it relates to the proportion of the AADT during the design hour for the design year. The Design Hour Volume (DHV) is total traffic in both directions expected to occur during the design hour for the design year, and it is determined by multiplying the AADT by the K factor. Equation 2-4 shows the relationship between AADT, DHV, and K:

$$DHV=AADT\times{K}$$
<div class="italic-grey">Equation 2-4</div>

<span class="subtitle-4">2.5.2.2 Standard K Factor Range</span>

The traditional practice of determining the K Factor has been using the hourly volume during the 30th highest hour in a year and dividing the hourly volume by AADT. This was first introduced in the 1950 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and the 30th highest hour was referred to as the design hour. It was inferred that designing a facility based on the 30th highest hourly volume of the year would be most cost-effective. Other peak hours, such as 100th highest hours, or 200th highest hour, have also been used to determine the K Factor. Even though the most accurate way to develop the K Factor is to have a Continuous TMS station on every roadway segment, this is very unlikely because of costs associated with maintaining and operating such a system. It is often necessary to estimate the K Factor using Short-term traffic counts.

In 2011, based on comprehensive analyses and extensive public outreach, FDOT established statewide “Standard K Factors” that was applied to develop project traffic forecast from the planning phase through the design phase of the project. Standard K Factors were fixed parameters predetermined based on area type and facility type with consideration to typical peak periods of the day. The Standard K Factors also reflected urban development patterns and economic activities. The purpose of using the statewide Standard K Factors was to promote better transportation policies and projects, reduce time and effort developing various peak hour numbers, and provide consistency and simplicity in project traffic development.

Over the last decade, there have been significant changes in travel patterns as the State experienced varying economic cycles. There has also been documented need for deviation from the Standard K Factors. In 2021, the FDOT Systems Implementation Office (SIO) initiated a review of the statewide practice to determine if a modification to the Standard K Factors is needed. The study concluded that there was indeed a need to update the current Standard K values. Based on the analysis performed using information obtained from the FDOT TDA and field count data, FDOT SIO developed a new approach and proposed changes to the current Standard K Factors. The approach and the recommendations are documented in the <b>FDOT White Paper – Standard K Evaluation (Appendix A)</b>. The recommended changes to the Florida Standard K Factors were formally approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on July 12, 2023. The approval letter can also be found in <b>Appendix A</b>.

The new approach to developing the Standard K Factors considers context classification, area type, and facility type of a roadway segment. The FDOT Context Classification System comprises eight (8) context classifications in its efforts to plan, design, construct and operate a context-sensitive system. The context classification system broadly identifies the various built environments existing in Florida. FDOT’s context classification system describes the general characteristics of the land use, development patterns, and roadway connectivity along a roadway, providing cues as to the types of uses and user groups that will utilize the roadway. The context classification of a roadway should be considered when selecting a Standard K Factor for the project. The eight types of context classifications are described and shown in <b>Figure 2-4</b>.

<div class="italic-grey">Figure 2-4 FDOT Context Classification</div>

The following changes to the current Standard K are recommended:

+ The Standard K should be converted from a single value to a Standard K Factor Range of two (2) percentage points
+ The roadway context classifications should be used when determining the Standard K Factor Range. Roadway classifications are defined based on context classifications where they are located. Based on roadway classifications having similar area types and the same recommended K Factor Range, the following roadway classifications are combined:

<div class="ul-circle">
  <ul>
  <li>C1-Natural, C2-Rural and C2T-Rural Town</li>
  <li>C3R-Suburban Residential, C3C-Suburban Commercial and C4-Urban General</li>
  <li>C5-Urban Center and C6-Urban Core</li>
  </ul>
</div>

+ Three additional roadway classifications are included for limited access facilities:

<div class="ul-circle">
  <ul>
  <li>Limited Access-Rural</li>
  <li>Limited Access-Urban</li>
  <li>Limited Access-Urban Core</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Urban and urban core areas are defined as an approved boundary, which encompasses the entire Census Urbanized Area, as well as the surrounding geographic area likely to become urbanized within the next 20 years, as agreed on by FDOT, FHWA, and the MPOs. Urban core area types are distinguished by whether the area’s population is more or less than one (1) million. Currently, the grouping of more than one (1) million applies to the urban areas that include central cities: Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, St. Petersburg, Tampa, and West Palm Beach. The minimum population for an urban area is 5,000. Generally, for a rural area, the population is less than 5,000 and not immediately adjacent to an urban core or urban areas.

<ul><i>FDOT has adopted a Context Classification System comprising eight context classifications in its efforts to plan, design, construct, and operate a context-sensitive system of Complete Streets. The context classification of a roadway, together with its transportation characteristics, will provide information about the users along the roadway, the regional and local travel demand of the roadway, and the challenges and opportunities of each user. The context classification of a roadway should be considered when selecting a Standard K Factor for the project.</i></ul>

FDOT’s recommended standard K Factor Ranges are presented in <b>Table 2-1</b>. The single Standard K Factor currently provided on <a href="https://tdaappsprod.dot.state.fl.us/fto/" target="_blank">Florida Traffic Online</a> for each count location would be replaced with the recommended K Factor Range based on the count locations' roadway context classification in the future in coordination with the TDA Office.

Approved by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on July 12, 2023.<br><br>
Notes:<br>

(1) A single K Factor, within the range, should be selected based on the project’s conditions.<br>
(2) Refer to <a href="https://fdotwww.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/roadway/completestreets/files/fdot-context-classification.pdf?sfvrsn=12be90da_2" target="_blank">FDOT Context Classification Guide</a> when determining roadway context classification.<br>
(3) A K factor has a theoretical minimum value of 4.17%, or 1/24, which corresponds to the condition where there is no peaking during the entire 24-hour period. K factors outside the recommended K Ranges would need to be discussed and approved by the Systems Implementation Office (SIO). K Factors lower than 4.17% will not be accepted.<br>
(4) K factors are not applicable for the planning, design or operation of toll facilities or managed lanes.
