keywords: "Scoping is a critical step in the project traffic forecasting process. It involves defining the project’s objectives, identifying the required resources, and determining the scope of work needed to complete the forecasting. Scoping provides a roadmap for the entire project and helps ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

Effective scoping is particularly important in traffic forecasting because it helps ensure that the project’s forecasts are accurate, reliable, and useful for traffic analysis and following phases of the project. The process of scoping involves identifying the key variables that will impact the project’s forecasts and ensuring that the appropriate data and forecasting methods are used to produce reliable results.

In this chapter, a detailed overview of the project traffic forecasting scoping process will be provided. The detailed overview will outline the key factors to be considered, the scoping process, and the suggested documentation for traffic forecasting. These key considerations may include the project’s objectives, project limits, data requirements, available resources, timelines, and forecasting methods, among others. The intention of the chapter is to provide knowledge and guidance to successfully scope a project’s traffic forecasting in an effort to produce reliable, accurate, and useful forecasts for transportation planning and decision-making purposes.

  Important Note:
Scoping provides a roadmap for the entire project and helps ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and meet the goals and objectives of the project.

Scoping is a critical step in the Project Traffic Forecasting process. It involves defining the project’s
objectives, identifying the required resources, and determining the scope of work needed to
complete the forecasting. Scoping provides a roadmap for the entire project and helps ensure that
the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

Effective scoping is particularly important in traffic forecasting because it helps ensure that the
project’s forecasts are accurate, reliable, and useful for traffic analysis and the following phases of
the project. The process of scoping involves identifying key variables that will impact the project’s
forecasts and ensuring that the appropriate data and forecasting methods are used to produce
reliable results.

In this chapter, a detailed overview of the Project Traffic Forecasting scoping process is provided. The
detailed overview will outline key factors to be considered, the scoping process, and the suggested
documentation for traffic forecasting. These key considerations may include the project’s objectives,
project limits, data requirements, available resources, timelines, and forecasting methods, among
others. This chapter aims to provide the guidance to successfully scope a project’s traffic forecasting
and support the production of reliable, accurate, and useful forecasts for transportation planning
and decision-making purposes.
