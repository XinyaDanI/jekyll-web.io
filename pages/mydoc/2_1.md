Data sources are an essential component for traffic forecasting to provide an understanding of
current conditions, evaluate the impacts of different scenarios, and develop traffic estimates for
future conditions. Different types of data can be used for a project, depending on the objectives,
selected forecasting methodology, scope, and budget of the project. Common data types include
traffic data, socioeconomic factors, land use patterns, and transportation network characteristics.
Data sets can be collected or compiled from a variety of different sources, such as traffic sensors
installed in the field, household travel surveys, research institutions, U.S. Census Bureau, and various

new travel-related information that was not previously available.
