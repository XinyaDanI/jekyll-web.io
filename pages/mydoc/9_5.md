keywords: "The use of a regional travel demand model in combination with the ELToD Static Assignment Model is the preferred method to prepare project traffic forecasts for Express Lanes. ELToD is a stand-alone application that follows the FSUTMS standards and works in conjunction with all Florida’s travel demand models. ELToD was initially calibrated using 2011 data from I-95 Express Phase 1. Since then, ELToD has been re-calibrated against observed data in Broward and Palm Beach Counties on both I-95 Express Phase 1-4 and I-595 Express. Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise has used ELToD for project traffic forecasting for numerous projects around the state in the South Florida, Central Florida, and West Central Florida regions.

Table 9-1 Express Lanes Project Traffic Forecasting Methods Used in Florida ELToD estimates the volume of traffic by hour on both general use and Express Lanes by applying Equation 9-1 to O-D matrices from any travel demand model, including models that already have Express Lanes functionality in the highway assignment process. ELToD also identifies the Express Lanes dynamic toll and congested speeds by hour based on traffic conditions. The ELToD model has a robust choice model component in a controlled environment that can account for various factors that are involved in Express Lanes choice, such as reliability, comfort, safety, lane preference and avoidance of trucks. ELToD provides robust results with quick run times; yet is detailed enough for project traffic forecasting and for Express Lanes ingress/egress traffic operations testing.

In ELToD, the percentage of traffic using the Express Lanes, or Express Lanes share, is calculated using the equation below. The equation reflects the latest representation of the toll choice model.

ExpressLanesShare=11+e(−1∗(βconstant+βTime∗Time+βToll∗Toll+βReliability∗Reliability−DistancePenalty))
Equation 9-1
Where:

βConstant
 - This parameter determines the Express Lanes share when time, toll, and reliability have a net zero effect.

βTime
 - This parameter is for the travel time coefficient in the choice model equation defined in the ELToD Model as the Travel Time Coefficient (with units of 1/min). This is the disutility of increasing travel time by one minute.

βToll
 - This parameter is for the toll cost coefficient in the choice model equation defined in the ELToD Model as the Toll Coefficient (with units of 1/$). This is the disutility of increasing the toll by one dollar.

βReliability
 - This parameter is calculated from a Reliability Ratio (defined in the ELToD Model as the Reliability Coefficient Ratio) and the travel time coefficient. It indicates the disutility of one unit (one minute) of standard deviation.

DistancePenalty
 – This parameter is a penalty applied to trips that may use the Express Lanes for a short distance to discourage short Express Lanes trips.

The ELToD Model procedure uses four primary sets of inputs:

Total estimated subarea project traffic (in a matrix layout) at a period or daily level.
Hourly distribution of total traffic within the project corridor (by direction), based on observed traffic data.
Geometric configuration of the subarea network links: link lengths, free flow speed, lane capacity, and link facility type.
Toll costs: Pricing policy curve, including toll rate limits (minimum and maximum toll rates).
The steps to use ELToD for project traffic forecasting are as follows:

Obtain inputs (1, 2, and 3 above) from the validated regional travel demand model.
Obtain input (4 above) from the current FDOT toll pricing policy.
Create a subarea model with Express Lanes and apply ELToD.
Update the ELToD model parameters, consistent with guidance in the ELToD – User Guide and Documentation.
Run the ELToD model.
The following model output data is extracted from the link data, and summarized by hour and direction:

Volume
Time of Day Percent
Express Lanes Share
V/C Ratio
Congested Speed
Tolls
Revenue
For more detailed information about the ELToD Static Assignment Model, please refer to the ELToD – User Guide and Documentation. This report can be requested through the Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise, Toll Studies & Express Lanes Development Department.

It should be recognized that there have been some research efforts to evaluate the use of mesoscopic dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models, such as Cube Avenue and DTALite, for Express Lanes forecasting. However, these methods would require significant programming and calibration efforts to include the ELToD toll choice model methodology. An ELToD DTA version has been developed by the Florida’s Turnpike Toll Studies & Express Lanes Development Department and can be made available upon request.
