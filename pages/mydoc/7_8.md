keywords: "In summary, there are some differences inherent to each of the turning movement methods. Each of the methods differs in the amount of data input and the information generated. The following observations can be made regarding the two main tools used in Florida for developing turning movement volumes:

TURNS5-V2014 version incorporates the best of all the spreadsheets being used by the Districts. It can provide turning movement projections where detailed existing and future year data input parameters are available and applicable. It is suited for obtaining preliminary balanced turning movement projections where only approach volume information is available and/or applicable.
TMTool v2023 is an improved version that provides an easy-to-use application that can estimate future turning volumes for multiple periods at the same time, and for up to five (5) intersections to be processed simultaneously. Output functions are also enhanced to provide graphic representation of intersection turning movement volumes for different time periods and different analysis years to facilitate corridor level traffic volume smoothing and balancing. TMTool v2023 incorporates volume verification procedures to prevent zero or negative growth.
Procedures recommended in NCHRP Report 765 offer alternative ways of estimating turning movement volumes.

Users are advised to review the available data and applicability of the tools and select a method that is best suited for the project. If budget and schedule permit, use more than one method to evaluate the projected turning movement volumes. Professional judgement should always be exercised to check the reasonableness of the traffic projections."
