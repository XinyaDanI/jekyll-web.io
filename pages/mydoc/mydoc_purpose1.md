The purpose of the Handbook is to describe policies and procedures accepted by the
Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and offer guidelines on principles and
techniques for preparing project traffic required by various stages of the project
development process. The objective is to help standardize the traffic forecasting
process that will result in consistent and defendable project traffic on all applicable
transportation projects. The intended audience is transportation engineers and
planners who develop project traffic for various highway projects for FDOT and its
partner agencies in the state of Florida. This Handbook may be used by local
governments and other agencies to review, accept, or approve project traffic
developed for highway projects within their jurisdictions. This Handbook provides
directions for Corridor Traffic Forecasting, Project Traffic Forecasting, and Equivalent
Single Axle Load (ESAL) Forecasting. This handbook supplements the Project Traffic
Forecasting Procedure Topic No. 525-030-120.
