keywords: "When using model output for determining project traffic forecasting, plots of the study area should be maintained in the file. Tabulation of the forecasts for the interim and design year with appropriate documentation of the methodology and reasonableness evaluation should be included in an individual section of the Project Traffic Forecasting Report. This information should then be utilized in the development of forecast year turning movement volumes and axle loadings as described in this Handbook.

4.8.1 Turning Movement Schematics

Schematic diagrams of the project should be completed if turning movements are involved. These diagrams should show AADTs, turning movements, K, D, and T factors. The user can use output figures from TURNS5 or TMTool as described in Chapter 7 as potential templates to show the turning movement volumes.

4.8.2 Certification

A certified report including K, D, T, base year AADT, forecasted AADTs, and an 18-KIP ESAL forecast (if applicable) should be sent to the requestor with copies sent to the appropriate district personnel. The project traffic shall be certified using the fillable portable document format (PDF) of the standard forms shown in Figure 4-6. If an 18-KIP ESAL is requested, use the certification form shown in Figure 4-7. All assumptions used in the estimation process and all the conditions to be considered when using the data should be included in the final report.

When using model output for determining Project Traffic Forecasting, plots of the study area
should be maintained in the file. Tabulation of the forecasts for the interim and design year
with appropriate documentation of the methodology and reasonableness evaluation should be
included in an individual section of the Project Traffic Forecasting Report. This information should
then be utilized in the development of forecast year turning movement volumes and axle loadings
as described in this Handbook.

A certified report including K, D, T, base year AADT, forecasted AADTs, and an 18-KIP ESAL forecast
(if applicable) should be sent to the requestor with copies provided to the appropriate District
personnel. The project traffic shall be certified (typically by the District Planning Office) using the
fillable portable document format (PDF) of the standard form shown in <b>Figure 4-6</b>. If an 18-KIP
ESAL is requested, use the certification form shown in <b>Figure 4-7</b>. All assumptions used in the
estimation process and all conditions to be considered when using the data should be included in
the final report.
