<div style="text-align: justify"> Project traffic estimates are required for planning, Project Development and Environment (PD&E) studies, and Resurfacing, Restoration, and Rehabilitation (RRR) projects. Traffic analyses of the Project Traffic Process evaluate the impacts of proposed transportation facilities and assess the effectiveness of the improvements. The FDOT Design Manual (Chapter 306) requires traffic data consistent with the data used for pavement design to be included for each typical section. The Project Traffic Forecasting Handbook offers guidelines and techniques for Corridor Traffic Forecasting studies, Project-Level Traffic Forecasting studies, and 18-KIP Equivalent Single Axle Load (ESAL) studies.</div>

### **CORRIDOR**

<div style="text-align: justify"> Corridor projects usually require the development of traffic projections that are used
to make decisions with important capacity and capital investment implications. The
Corridor Traffic Forecasting is required before establishing a new alignment or
widening of an existing facility.</div>

### **PROJECT**

<div style="text-align: justify">The Project Traffic projections are commonly used to develop lane configuration.requirements for intersection designs, and to evaluate the operational efficiency of proposed improvements. Project Traffic Forecasting is also required for
reconstruction, resurfacing, lane addition, bridge replacement, new roadway
projects, and major intersection improvements. This process differs from Corridor
Traffic Forecasting in that it is site-specific and covers a limited geographic area.</div>



### **ESAL** 
<div style="text-align: justify">The ESAL Forecasting Process is required for the pavement design for new construction, reconstruction, and resurfacing projects that require a structural loading forecast.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Project-level travel demand forecasting plays an important role in the project
development and delivery process. Project traffic and traffic parameters are needed
in developing performance measures to prioritize transportation improvements,
conducting alternative analysis to select the preferred alternative, providing design
parameters to support geometric and structural design, and developing traffic
management plans to mitigate the negative impact during construction.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Corridor Traffic Forecasting and Project Traffic Forecasting projects require forecasts
of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and Design Hour Volumes (DHV). AADT and
DHV are related to each other by the ratio commonly known as the K-factor.
The overall truck volume and AADT are related to each other by the T-factor. The
total impact of truck traffic on pavement design is expressed in units of ESALs, which
represent truck axle weights converted into 18,000-pound (18-KIP) loads carried by a
single, four-tire axle.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">RRR projects only require the ESAL process to determine the appropriate Load
Equivalency Factor for the pavement to be laid. Traffic improvement projects, such
as improving shoulders or turn lanes and restriping roads are not covered under the
ESAL forecasting process. </div>
